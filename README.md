Experimental chrome extension.

This is a fork of another experiment:

- Blog post about it: https://medium.com/content-uneditable/lets-create-a-screen-reader-6734fe45aa3d

It is also inspired by WebAIMs WAVE extension (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wave-evaluation-tool/jbbplnpkjmmeebjpijfedlgcdilocofh?hl=de).

⚠️ This is just a proof of concept, the screenreading is limited to a few elements.

## Install

1. Open chrome extensions
2. Activate developer mode
3. Select "Load unpacked" and load this folder

See: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/

## Background

I just want to find an easy (and in best case automated way) to empower devs to check the screenreader output/navigation of their websites - even if they did not learn how to operate a real screenreader yet. 

In my personal opinion an approach with buttons instead of keyboard shortcuts could be promising for a11y beginners. (I tweeted about this as well, see https://twitter.com/m_andrasch/status/1383359690730459143). 

Disclaimer: I'm an a11y newbie, suggestions are welcome.
